# Hi, I'm Fabio.
I'm a back-end developer from Italy and a student graduating in IT (AI curriculum) at [Unical](informatica.unical.it).
I primarily specialize in C++, Python and Java but I also have some experience with HTML, JavaScript and TypeScript (AngularJS). I'm also familiar with Perl and the Unix Shell.
## Currently working on...
Exams. Will graduate in 2025 Q1.
